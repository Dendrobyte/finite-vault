# Finite Vault - Frontend

Project repository for finite vault's frontend!

This project is built with Vite + Vue, so you will need both of those libraries.

Additionally, you will need Node `v21.7.3` (or higher).

## Project Setup

Default `npm` instructions as provided by the template.

### Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development
